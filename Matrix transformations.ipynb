    "<h1 align=\"center\">Using Matricies as Linear Transformations to Perform Rotations of Images</h1>\n",

    "\n",
    "Matrices are powerful tools for representing transformations in mathematics, particularly in geometry. They can be thought of as functions that modify vectors in space, where the vector represents a point or direction. In this case, we will be working with 2D points that represent pixels in an image, though the concept extends to higher dimensions as well. A matrix applied to a vector can perform a variety of operations, such as translating, scaling, or rotating the vector. In linear algebra, these matrices that act as functions are called *transformations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common transformations that can be expressed using matrices include **shear matrices** (which tilt the vector in one direction), **scaling matrices** (which resize the vector by a constant factor), and **rotation matrices** (which rotate the vector around the origin by a specified angle). Each type of transformation affects the components of a vector in predictable ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of rotation, we want to rotate an $(x, y)$ point around an angle $\\theta$. We may define the transformation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(\\vec{x}) = A\\vec{x} =\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\\n",
    "\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\\vec{x}$$\n",
    "where $\\vec{x}$ is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a transformation vector is defined in terms of where the standard basis vectors in that vector space get sent. For a matrix that serves as a transformation for vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the transformation matrix can be defined generically as: $$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "| & | \\\\\n",
    "T(e_1) & T(e_2) \\\\\n",
    "| & |\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular case, we are interested in what happens to a vector that gets sent through a transformation that rotates it about an angle $\\theta$. This may be better explained by an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the standard basis vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are interested in rotating these vectors about the angle $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (i.e. rotating the standard basis vectors 90°, or $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ rad), these vectors now become\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A^\\prime = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "0 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "1 & 0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard basis are sent to $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$. This defines our transformation since we know exactly where the standard basis vectors are being sent. Looking back at our generic formula from earlier, we set $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A =\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\\n",
